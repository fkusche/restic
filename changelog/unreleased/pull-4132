Enhancement: JSON logging: output "unchanged" only if level -vv

JSON logging now outputs "action": "unchanged" only, if the log level is at least -vv.
Previously, this also happened on log level -v.

Other actions like "new" and "modified" will still be printed
on log-level -v. That way it is possible to opt out of the
large amount of messages regarding "unchanged" files and dirs,
which might not be of interest and still get all the information
regarding what has changed to the previous snapshot.
